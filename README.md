# android-8
For some reason you need Android API 8 (Android SDK 8) in your project? here you can find it

## Why this repo exists?

Google deprecated this SDK for Mac and Windows, (this repo is Mac OS X version though), they hide the URL for downloading the 
SDK, becoming in a "SDK not available for Mac OS" error within Android studio.

## Solve it!

Clone this repo, choose your platforms SDK folder (mac, windows or linux) and copy the contents to:

<Your SDK Location>/platforms/android-8

In a Mac with default settings, it would be ~/Library/Android/sdk/platforms/android-8

*this SDK's revision is android-2.2_r02*
